* how to get a case of really bad clustering
In commit 158ff44, TaylorEM.compare_methjods(100,11) shows a case where EM fails to find a
global maximum in a very easy problem. I wrote a possible strategy for fixing this in my
google docs learning journal. Connecting the cov(T) matrix with the equilibrium problem,
leads to fast methods of choosing intelligent perturbations (using low-rank PCA on T).
